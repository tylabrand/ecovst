        For entrepreneurs and business owners in Kenya, choosing the right business structure is a critical decision 
        that impacts everything from daily operations to long-term growth potential. Among the various options available, 
        registering a Limited Liability Company (LLC) offers significant advantages that make it the preferred choice for 
        many businesses.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the key benefits of registering a limited liability company in Kenya, 
        the registration process, and important considerations to help you make an informed decision for your business.
      </p>

      <h2>What is a Limited Liability Company?</h2>
      
      <p>
        A Limited Liability Company (LLC) in Kenya, also known as a private limited company, is a business entity that 
        exists as a separate legal person from its owners (shareholders). This separation creates what's known as the 
        "corporate veil," which distinguishes the company's assets, liabilities, and legal obligations from those of 
        its shareholders.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Kenya, limited companies are regulated under the Companies Act, 2015, which provides the legal framework 
        for their formation, operation, and dissolution.
      </p>

      <h2>When Should You Consider a Limited Company Structure?</h2>
      
      <p>
        While a limited company structure offers many advantages, it's not necessarily the right choice for every business. 
        Consider registering a limited company if:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 my-4 text-gray-700">
        <li>You want to protect your personal assets from business liabilities</li>
        <li>You plan to seek external investment or financing</li>
        <li>Your business has multiple owners or will need to transfer ownership in the future</li>
        <li>You're entering a high-risk industry or taking on significant contracts</li>
        <li>You want to enhance your business's credibility with clients and partners</li>
        <li>You're planning for long-term growth and potential expansion</li>
      </ul>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-yellow-800">Important Considerations</h3>
            <p className="text-yellow-700 mt-2">
              While limited companies offer many benefits, they also come with increased regulatory requirements, 
              including annual returns filing, maintaining statutory registers, and more complex accounting. 
              These additional responsibilities should be factored into your decision.

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Limited companies have higher registration fees and ongoing compliance costs. Budget accordingly and 
            consider these expenses as an investment in your business's legal protection and credibility.

            Consider working with a company secretary or business services provider to ensure compliance.

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Limited companies face different tax requirements than sole proprietorships. Work with a qualified 
            accountant who understands corporate taxation to optimize your tax position while remaining compliant.
